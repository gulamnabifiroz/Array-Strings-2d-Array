<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7A </b></p>

## Aim

To demonstrate how to initialize an array and display its elements in C++.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory
<p>Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. An array is a collection of variables that are accessed with an index number.</p>

### Array Initialization

<p>An array can be initialized with predefined values at the time of declaration. The elements in the array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and each element can be accessed using an index.</p>

### Syntax 

```cpp
data_type array_name[array_size];
```
### Array Traversal

<p>Traversing an array involves accessing each element of the array sequentially. This can be done using loops such as for or while loops.</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare and initialize an array arr with 5 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
<br>
Step 3: Use a loop to traverse the array from the first element to the last.
<br>
Step 4: Print each element of the array.
<br>
Step 5: End.
<br>

## Output

An array in C++ is a collection of variables of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. To find the maximum and minimum values in an array, we need to traverse the array while keeping track of the largest and smallest values encountered.

### Array Traversal

To determine the maximum and minimum values, iterate through each element of the array and compare each element with the current maximum and minimum values. Update the maximum or minimum as needed.

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare an integer variable size and read the size of the array from the user.
<br>
Step 3: Declare an array arr of size size.

<br>
<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7G </b></p>

## Aim

To write a C++ program that displays a string.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory
<p>In C++, strings are objects that represent sequences of characters. The C++ Standard Library provides the std::string class, which supports various operations like concatenation. Concatenating two strings means appending the second string to the end of the first string, creating a new string that combines the content of both.</p>

### String Concatenation
<p>String concatenation in C++ can be done using the '+' operator, which merges two strings into a new string.</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare two 'std::string' variables 'str1' and 'str2' to hold the user inputs.
<br>
Step 3: Declare another 'std::string' variable 'newstr' to store the concatenated result.
<br>
Step 4: Prompt the user to enter the first string and store it in 'str1'.
<br>
Step 5: Prompt the user to enter the second string and store it in 'str2'.
<br>
Step 6: Concatenate 'str1' and 'str2' using the '+' operator and store the result in 'newstr'.
<br>
Step 7: Display the concatenated string 'newstr'.
<br>
Step 8: End.
<br>

## Output

## Conclusion

The program successfully concatenates two user-provided strings and displays the result. The '+' operator in C++ efficiently combines the strings into a new string, demonstrating a fundamental operation on string objects.


<br>
<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7H </b></p>

## Aim

To reverse and display a string provided by the user.


## Software Used

- Dev C++
  
## Theory

<p>In C++, a 'std::string' represents a sequence of characters. Reversing a string involves printing the characters of the string in reverse order. This can be achieved by iterating from the end of the string to the beginning.</p>

### String Reversal

<p>To reverse a string, we iterate from the last character to the first character of the string, printing each character in this order. This approach does not modify the original string but displays its reversed version.</p>


## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare a 'std::string' variable 'word' to store the user input.
<br>
Step 3: Prompt the user to enter a string and read the input into 'word'.
<br>
Step 4: Determine the length of the string using 'word.length()'.
<br>
Step 5: Iterate from the last character to the first character of the string.
<br>
Step 6: Print each character during the iteration.
<br>
Step 7: End.
<br>

## Output

## Conclusion

<p>The program successfully reverses and displays a user-provided string. Iterating through the string from end to start effectively demonstrates how to reverse a string in C++. This approach highlights the manipulation of string indices to achieve the desired output.</p>


<br>
<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7I </b></p>

## Aim
To determine whether a given string is a palindrome.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory
<p>A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. To check if a string is a palindrome, we compare characters from the beginning of the string with characters from the end, moving towards the center. If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.</p>

### Palindrome Check
<p>The palindrome check involves:
<br>
1. Comparing the first and last characters of the string.
 <br>
2. Moving inward and comparing each subsequent pair of characters.
  <br>
3. If any pair does not match, the string is not a palindrome.</p>
<br>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare a 'std::string' variable 'str' to store the user input.
<br>
Step 3: Initialize a boolean variable 'isPalindrome' to 'true'.
<br>
Step 4: Prompt the user to enter a string and read the input into 'str'.
<br>
Step 5: Determine the length of the string using 'str.length()'.
<br>
Step 6: Iterate from the start of the string to the middle, comparing characters from the beginning and the end of the string.
<br>
Step 7: If any characters do not match, set isPalindrome to false and exit the loop.
<br>
Step 8: After the loop, check the value of isPalindrome: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If true, the string is a palindrome.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If false, the string is not a palindrome.
<br>
Step 9: End.
<br>

## Output

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80e8560d-4876-4466-b096-9c47d2d11df0)

## Conclusion
The program accurately determines whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If all compared characters match, the string is identified as a palindrome; otherwise, it is not. This method efficiently checks for palindromes with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

<br>
Step 7: Declare a 2D array arr2 of size sizer1 by sizec2 to store the elements of the second matrix.
<br>
Step 8: Prompt the user to input the elements of the second matrix.
<br>
Step 9: Check if the sizes of the matrices are the same:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are the same, proceed with the addition.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, display a message that the sizes should be the same for addition.
<br>
Step 10:For each element in the matrices, calculate the sum of the corresponding elements and store the result in a new matrix sum.
<br>
Step 11:Display the sum matrix.
<br>
Step 12:End.

## Theory
<p>
  Matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix. The number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix for multiplication to be possible. The resulting matrix has dimensions that correspond to the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix.
</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare variables rowsA, colsA, rowsB, and colsB to store the number of rows and columns of the matrices.
<br>
Step 3: Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for Matrix A and store them in rowsA and colsA.
<br>
Step 4: Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for Matrix B and store them in rowsB and colsB.
<br>
Step 5: Check matrix dimensions:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of columns in Matrix A (colsA) is not equal to the number of rows in Matrix B (rowsB), output an error message indicating that matrix multiplication is not possible and exit the program.
<br>
Step 6: Declare 2D arrays A and B for storing Matrix A and Matrix B, and C for storing the result of the multiplication.
<br>
Step 7: Prompt the user to input the elements of Matrix A.
<br>
Step 8: Prompt the user to input the elements of Matrix B.
<br>
Step 9: Initialize the result matrix C to zero.
<br>
Step 10: Perform matrix multiplication:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each element in the result matrix C, compute the sum of products of corresponding elements from the rows of Matrix A and the columns of Matrix B.
<br>
Step 11: Display the result matrix.
<br>
Step 12: End.

This program computes the sum of both the forward and reverse diagonals for a square matrix.
</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start. 
<br> 
Step 2: Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix. 
<br>
Step 3: Check if the matrix is square (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns). If not, display an error message and terminate.
<br> 
Step 4: Declare a 2D array to store the matrix elements. 
<br> 
Step 5: Populate the matrix by reading elements from the user. 
<br> 
Step 6: Initialize variables to store the sums of the forward diagonal and reverse diagonal elements.
<br> 
Step 7: Traverse the matrix:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the forward diagonal, sum the elements where the row and column indices are equal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reverse diagonal, sum the elements where the row index plus the column index equals n-1. 
<br>
Step 8: Display the matrix and the calculated sums of both diagonals. 
<br> 
Step 9: End.
